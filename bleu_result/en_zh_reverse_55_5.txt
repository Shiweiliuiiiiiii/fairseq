T-235	The main reasons for the approach of the UNCITRAL Secured Transactions Guide with respect to outright transfers of receivables are: (i) the need to have a comprehensive set of priority rules where there are multiple assignments of the same receivables by the same assignor mainly based on registration (with the exception of receivables embodied in negotiable instruments with respect to which possession gives a superior security right); (ii) the need to address a priority conflict between an assignment by way of security, an outright assignment and the creation of a security right in a receivable; and (iii) the difficulty of third parties to determine whether an assignment is by way of security, an outright assignment or a transaction creating a security right in a receivable.
