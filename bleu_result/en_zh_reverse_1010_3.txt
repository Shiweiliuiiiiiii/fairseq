T-1403	Provoked, in part, by Arab neighbors’ hostility and Palestinian leaders’ intransigence, Israel began to turn sharply to the right. This was also the result of demographic changes: Middle Eastern Jews were more viscerally anti-Arab than their European brethren, and Jewish immigrants from Russia were viscerally anti-left.

Furthermore, the number of legitimate Jews continues to grow rapidly.

S-235	__zh__ 84. 《贸易法委员会担保交易指南》在应收款彻底转让方面采取这种办法的理由主要有:(i)对于同一转让人主要通过登记方式多次转让同一笔应收款的情形需要有一套综合性的优先权规则(可转让票据所代表的应收款除外,占有可转让票据便具有较优先的担保权);(ii)需要解决担保式转让与彻底转让之间的优先权冲突;(iii)第三方很难确定一项转让是担保式转让、彻底转让还是在应收款上设定担保权的交易。
T-235	The main reasons for the approach of the UNCITRAL Secured Transactions Guide with respect to outright transfers of receivables are: (i) the need to have a comprehensive set of priority rules where there are multiple assignments of the same receivables by the same assignor mainly based on registration (with the exception of receivables embodied in negotiable instruments with respect to which possession gives a superior security right); (ii) the need to address a priority conflict between an assignment by way of security, an outright assignment and the creation of a security right in a receivable; and (iii) the difficulty of third parties to determine whether an assignment is by way of security, an outright assignment or a transaction creating a security right in a receivable.
H-235	-0.9357076287269592	The reasons for the use of this approach in the transfer of the total amount of the receipt are mainly the following: (i) a comprehensive priority rule for the same transferr, mainly through registration, in the case of multiple transfers of the total amount of the receipt (excluding the receipt represented by the certificate of transfer, which would have a higher priority); (ii) a conflict of priority between the secured transfer and the complete transfer; and (iii) the difficulty for third parties to determine whether a transfer is a secured transfer, the complete transfer or the transfer of the security right on the receipt.
